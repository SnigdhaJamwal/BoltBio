#### AIM: Create a pipeline for target identification by integrating the different methods of analysis

Types of Analysis:  

I) Differential gene analyis    
   1. What is differential gene analysis?
   2. Which kind of data does it require?
   3. Which data formats are used to store the data used in the analysis?
   4. Python packages used in the analysis
   5. Algorithms and tests required for the analysis
   6. Conclusions that can be derived from the analysis
   
II) Mutation Analysis

i) What are mutations?
      
A mutation is a change in a DNA sequence. Mutations can result from DNA copying mistakes made during cell division, exposure to ionizing radiation, exposure to chemicals called mutagens, or infection by viruses. Germ line mutations occur in the eggs and sperm and can be passed on to offspring, while somatic mutations occur in body cells and are not passed on.

ii) What is mutation analysis? 
   
Mutational Analysis is testing for the presence of a specific mutation or set of mutations, as opposed to    complete gene sequencing or mutation scanning, which detect most, if not all, mutations in the tested region. 
   - Sequence homology approach: Helps us to understand what are the significant positions of the protein sequence when it comes to the mutation and whether they are conserved or not.
   - Sequence Structural approach: Analyses the structure and the sequence of the protein
   - Sequence similarity approach: Carries out a sequence similarity matrix in order to understand what the mutations are
   - Conservation based approach  

iii) Packages used in the analysis

a) [DeepVarient](https://github.com/google/deepvariant#how-deepvariant-works) [Python and C++]: An analysis pipeline that uses a deep neural network to call genetic variants from next-generation DNA sequencing data.  

*Pipeline:* 
1. Make examples: creates tf.Example protos for training/calling
2. Call Variants: calling variants with a trained DeepVariant model 
3. Post process variants: Postprocess output from call_variants to produce a VCF file

*Input:* 
1.  A reference genome in [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format)
    format and its corresponding
    [.fai index file](http://www.htslib.org/doc/faidx.html) generated using the
    `samtools faidx` command.

2.  An aligned reads file in [BAM](http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BAM) or [CRAM] format
    and its corresponding index file (.bai). The reads must be aligned to the
    reference genome described above.
    
*Different input types and their corresponding models:*  

Aligned reads from:  
*   NGS (Illumina) data for either a
    [whole genome](docs/deepvariant-case-study.md) (WGS model) or [whole exome](docs/deepvariant-exome-case-study.md) (WES model).
*   PacBio HiFi data (PACBIO model) , see the
    [PacBio case study](docs/deepvariant-pacbio-model-case-study.md).
*   Hybrid PacBio HiFi + Illumina WGS (HYBRID model), see the
    [hybrid case study](docs/deepvariant-hybrid-case-study.md).
*   Oxford Nanopore long-read data by using
    [PEPPER-DeepVariant](https://github.com/kishwarshafin/pepper).
*   GenapSys data, by using a
    [model retrained by GenapSys](https://github.com/GenapsysInc/genapsys_deepvariant/blob/master/docs/GenapSys_DeepVariant_WES_Model.md).

*Output:*  
1. A list of all variant calls in VCF format or the [gVCF format](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/docs/deepvariant-gvcf-support.md#creating-gvcf-output-with-deepvariant) . 
2. An [VCF stats report](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/docs/deepvariant-vcf-stats-report.md) as a .html file

b) [DeepTrio](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/docs/deeptrio-details.md): DeepTrio is built on top of DeepVariant. It is intended for variant calling of trios or duos. The main advantage of DeepTrio is that genetic inheritance is considered by a neural network for calling variants in trio samples. Also, variant candidates are generated from all samples at once, which ensures a genotype call is made for any position in the trio with a variant.  

*Pipeline (Same as DeepVariant):*
1. Make examples: creates tf.Example protos for training/calling
2. Call Variants: calling variants with a trained DeepVariant model 
3. Post process variants: Postprocess output from call_variants to produce a VCF file

*Input:*  
1. A reference genome in FASTA format and its corresponding .fai index file generated using the samtools faidx command.
2. An aligned reads files for child and one or two parents in BAM format and its corresponding index file (.bai). The reads must be aligned to the reference genome described above.

*Different input data types and their corresponding models:*

*  Illumina whole genome data (WGS).
*  Illumina whole exome data (WES).
*  PacBio HiFi whole genome data (PacBio WGS).

*Output:*
A set of variants in VCF format representing the child and one or two parents.

c) [BayesPI-BAR2](https://junbaiw.github.io/BayesPI-BAR2/) [Python]: BayesPI-BAR2 is a package designed to predict how non-coding somatic mutations in cancer samples affect protein-DNA binding at the mutated place. Changes in binding of transcription factors to mutated regulatory sequences can lead to disrupted gene regulation, which may promote tumorigenesis. BayesPI-BAR2 takes into account the possibility for several nearby mutations to affect binding of the same protein. The predicted effects are tested for significance in the given patient cohort, and only those that appear in patient samples more frequently than expected by chance are reported.

d) [seqfam](https://seqfam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_and_api.html): Seqfam package is primarily designed for analysing next generation sequencing (NGS) DNA data from families with known pedigree information in order to identify rare variants that are potentially causal of a disease/trait of interest.

e) [MutaNET](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mutanet/) [Python]: It includes a next generation sequencing (NGS) pipeline that calls mutations based on paired-end NGS reads, an automated analysis tool and various file converters and mergers. The mutation analysis feature considers the coding region, protein domains, regulation and transcription factor binding site information, and can be used to analyse the potential impact of mutations on genes of interest.  

f) [Orchid](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/6/936/4587584): Orchid is a python based software package for the management, annotation and machine learning of cancer mutations.

c) [DeepSea](https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/deepsea/): DeepSEA is a deep learning-based algorithmic framework for predicting the chromatin effects of sequence alterations with single nucleotide sensitivity. DeepSEA can accurately predict the epigenetic state of a sequence, including transcription factors binding, DNase I sensitivities and histone marks in multiple cell types, and further utilize this capability to predict the chromatin effects of sequence variants and prioritize regulatory variants.
