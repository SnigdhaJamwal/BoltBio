#### AIM: Create a pipeline for target identification by integrating the different methods of analysis

Types of Analysis:  

I) Differential gene analyis</dt>     
   1. What is differential gene analysis?
   2. Which kind of data does it require?
   3. Which data formats are used to store the data used in the analysis?
   4. Python packages used in the analysis
   5. Algorithms and tests required for the analysis
   6. Conclusions that can be derived from the analysis
   
II) Mutation Analysis

i) What are mutations?
      
A mutation is a change in a DNA sequence. Mutations can result from DNA copying mistakes made during cell division, exposure to ionizing radiation, exposure to chemicals called mutagens, or infection by viruses. Germ line mutations occur in the eggs and sperm and can be passed on to offspring, while somatic mutations occur in body cells and are not passed on.

ii) What is mutation analysis? 
   
Mutational Analysis is testing for the presence of a specific mutation or set of mutations, as opposed to    complete gene sequencing or mutation scanning, which detect most, if not all, mutations in the tested region. 
   - Sequence homology approach: Helps us to understand what are the significant positions of the protein sequence when it comes to the mutation and whether they are conserved or not.
   - Sequence Structural approach: Analyses the structure and the sequence of the protein
   - Sequence similarity approach: Carries out a sequence similarity matrix in order to understand what the mutations are
   - Conservation based approach  

iii) Packages used in the analysis

a) [DeepVarient](https://github.com/google/deepvariant#how-deepvariant-works) [Python]: An analysis pipeline that uses a deep neural network to call genetic variants from next-generation DNA sequencing data.
