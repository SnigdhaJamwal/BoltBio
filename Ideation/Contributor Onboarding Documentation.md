#### AIM: Create a pipeline for target identification by integrating the different methods of analysis

Types of Analysis:  

I) Differential gene analyis    
   1. What is differential gene analysis?
   2. Which kind of data does it require?
   3. Which data formats are used to store the data used in the analysis?
   4. Python packages used in the analysis
   5. Algorithms and tests required for the analysis
   6. Conclusions that can be derived from the analysis

II) Mutation Analysis

i) What are mutations?
      
A mutation is a change in a DNA sequence. Mutations can result from DNA copying mistakes made during cell division, exposure to ionizing radiation, exposure to chemicals called mutagens, or infection by viruses. Germ line mutations occur in the eggs and sperm and can be passed on to offspring, while somatic mutations occur in body cells and are not passed on.

ii) What is mutation analysis? 
   
Mutational Analysis is testing for the presence of a specific mutation or set of mutations, as opposed to    complete gene sequencing or mutation scanning, which detect most, if not all, mutations in the tested region. 
   - Sequence homology approach: Helps us to understand what are the significant positions of the protein sequence when it comes to the mutation and whether they are conserved or not.
   - Sequence Structural approach: Analyses the structure and the sequence of the protein
   - Sequence similarity approach: Carries out a sequence similarity matrix in order to understand what the mutations are
   - Conservation based approach  

iii) Packages used in the analysis

a) [DeepVarient](https://github.com/google/deepvariant#how-deepvariant-works) [Python and C++]: An analysis pipeline that uses a deep neural network to call genetic variants from next-generation DNA sequencing data.  

*Pipeline:* 
1. Make examples: creates tf.Example protos for training/calling
2. Call Variants: calling variants with a trained DeepVariant model 
3. Post process variants: Postprocess output from call_variants to produce a VCF file

*Input:* 
1.  A reference genome in [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format)
    format and its corresponding
    [.fai index file](http://www.htslib.org/doc/faidx.html) generated using the
    `samtools faidx` command.

2.  An aligned reads file in [BAM](http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BAM) or [CRAM] format
    and its corresponding index file (.bai). The reads must be aligned to the
    reference genome described above.
    
*Different input types and their corresponding models:*  

Aligned reads from:  
*   NGS (Illumina) data for either a
    [whole genome](docs/deepvariant-case-study.md) (WGS model) or [whole exome](docs/deepvariant-exome-case-study.md) (WES model).
*   PacBio HiFi data (PACBIO model) , see the
    [PacBio case study](docs/deepvariant-pacbio-model-case-study.md).
*   Hybrid PacBio HiFi + Illumina WGS (HYBRID model), see the
    [hybrid case study](docs/deepvariant-hybrid-case-study.md).
*   Oxford Nanopore long-read data by using
    [PEPPER-DeepVariant](https://github.com/kishwarshafin/pepper).
*   GenapSys data, by using a
    [model retrained by GenapSys](https://github.com/GenapsysInc/genapsys_deepvariant/blob/master/docs/GenapSys_DeepVariant_WES_Model.md).

*Output:*  
1. A list of all variant calls in VCF format or the [gVCF format](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/docs/deepvariant-gvcf-support.md#creating-gvcf-output-with-deepvariant) . 
2. An [VCF stats report](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/docs/deepvariant-vcf-stats-report.md) as a .html file

b) [DeepTrio](https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.2/docs/deeptrio-details.md): DeepTrio is built on top of DeepVariant. It is intended for variant calling of trios or duos. The main advantage of DeepTrio is that genetic inheritance is considered by a neural network for calling variants in trio samples. Also, variant candidates are generated from all samples at once, which ensures a genotype call is made for any position in the trio with a variant.  

*Pipeline (Same as DeepVariant):*
1. Make examples: creates tf.Example protos for training/calling
2. Call Variants: calling variants with a trained DeepVariant model 
3. Post process variants: Postprocess output from call_variants to produce a VCF file

*Input:*  
1. A reference genome in FASTA format and its corresponding .fai index file generated using the samtools faidx command.
2. An aligned reads files for child and one or two parents in BAM format and its corresponding index file (.bai). The reads must be aligned to the reference genome described above.

*Different input data types and their corresponding models:*

*  Illumina whole genome data (WGS).
*  Illumina whole exome data (WES).
*  PacBio HiFi whole genome data (PacBio WGS).

*Output:*
A set of variants in VCF format representing the child and one or two parents.

III) Pathway Analysis 
PATHWAY ANALYSIS

OVERVIEW

High-throughput technologies have made it possible to measure gene expression levels of tens of thousands of genes and to compare the gene expression profiles between two phenotypes(disease vs. control, drug A vs. drug B). Various statistical approaches are used to identify the genes which are differentially expressed (DE) between these phenotypes, such as t test, Z-score, and ANOVA. Although such lists of genes provide valuable information regarding the changes across phenotypes, and play important roles in the downstream analysis, further analysis is required as they don't explain the complex mechanisms that are involved in the given condition[1].

Pathway analysis and gene set enrichment analysis(GSEA) are two very important approaches that aim to take gene expression levels and leverage existing knowledge about the given organism in order to identify the underlying biological processes and mechanisms. Pathways are models describing the interactions of genes, proteins, or metabolites within cells, tissues, or organisms, and the interactions are represented as a network with multiple, interrelated nodes and edges and not simple lists of genes. Gene sets, on the other hand, are unordered and unstructured collection of genes associated with a specific biological process (e.g. cell cycle), location (e.g. on chromosome 1), disease (e.g. breast cancer), or even the set of genes that are present in a given pathway (e.g. the set of 128 genes involved in the KEGG cell cycle pathway). While there are several categories by which gene sets can be classified, some of them can be arbitrary.  A very well rounded review detailing the difference between the two can be found [here](https://advaitabio.com/ipathwayguide/pathway-analysis-vs-gene-set-analysis/), but the key takeaways can be summarised as follows:

You'll need to perform pathway analysis when: 

-   You care about how genes are known to interact

-   You want to take full advantage of the sizes and directions of measured expression changes

-   You want to account for the type and direction of interactions on a pathway

-   You want to predict or explain downstream or pathway-level effects

-   when you are looking for mechanisms that are specifically affected in your experiment

-   when you want your results to be based on the most recent knowledge

You'll need GSEA when:

-   You are looking for "quick and dirty" answers 

-   You have arbitrarily defined gene sets.

Pathway analysis approaches use available pathway databases and the given gene expression data to identify the pathways which are significantly impacted in a given condition[2].It has helped in the  identification of the biological roles of candidate genes to only target the cancer cells and in determining the similarity and dissimilarity between cell lines and tumor samples, and helped in examining the biological function of a set of genes with putative connection between them which was yet to be validated[3].

The integrated analysis of omics data with pathway analysis has become very popular and  is employed in a number of large-scale projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Clinical Proteome Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Numerous approaches are available for interpreting single gene lists. For example, the GSEA algorithm can detect upregulated and downregulated pathways in gene expression datasets  Web-based methods such as Panther, ToppCluster  detect significantly enriched pathways amongst ranked or unranked gene lists and are generally applicable to genes  and proteins from various analyses[4].

Due to the evident importance of this type of analysis, more than 70 pathway analysis methods have been proposed so far. The [review ](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1790-4)by Nguyen, TM. et al., presents the comparison of the performances of 13 representative pathways analysis methods and the key takeaways are discussed briefly here and in detail in the Algorithms and Tests section. 

These pathway analysis methods can be divided into two different categories. The first category includes "non-topology-based" methods (non-TB methods, also known as gene set analysis methods), i.e., methods that do not take advantage of the existing knowledge regarding the positions and roles of the genes within the pathways, the directions and types of the signals transmitted from one gene to another, etc. The first generation in the non-TB category is the over-representation analysis (ORA).Some of the tools that leverage this method are GeneMAPP, GoMiner, DAVID, WebGestalt. This approach takes a list of DE genes as input and identifies the pathways in which the DE genes are over- or underrepresented. The second generation of non-TB approaches includes functional class scoring methods (FCS). The hypothesis behind this approach is that small but coordinated changes in sets of functionally related genes may also be important. This approach eliminates the dependency on the gene selection criteria by taking all gene expressions into consideration.Some of the popular FCS approaches are GSEA, Catmap, GlobalTest, sigPathway.

In considering the pathways as simple un-ordered and unstructured collection of genes---as the non-TB methods do--- we discard a substantial amount of knowledge about the biological processes described by these pathways.All the dependencies and interactions between genes that are meant to capture and describe the biological phenomenon are completely ignored. Topology-based methods (TB) have been developed in an attempt to include all this additional knowledge in the analysis. The impact analysis was the first such approach . This was followed by a plethora of over 30 tools and methods that fall in this category including Pathway-Express, SPIA, NetGSA, etc.

The data formats and availability, web-based tools and softwares,  Python packages, and algorithms are discussed in detail in the respective sections.

DATA TYPES AND FORMATS

Pathway analysis approach typically requires two types of input: experimental data and known biological networks. Most pathway analysis methods analyze data from high-throughput experiments, such as microarrays, next-generation sequencing, or proteomics. They accept either a list of gene IDs or a list of such gene IDs associated with measured changes. These changes could be measured with different technologies and therefore can serve as proxies for different biochemical entities.Biological networks or pathways are often represented in the form of graphs that capture our current knowledge about the interactions of genes, proteins, metabolites, or compounds in an organism.

Input Data Types and File Formats: Different analysis methods use different input formats and support (i) a list of differentially expressed (DE) genes, (ii) genes and their fold changes and (iii) an expression matrix. The first two input types can be directly entered on the website or uploaded from users' local machine as a .txt or .tsv file, in which each row represents a gene. For expression matrix input, a dataset can be represented by two .csv files (command-separated)---one for expression matrix and one for sample grouping. The sample grouping file has two columns in which the first column includes samples and the second column are their corresponding groups (e.g. control or disease).

Gene ID Conversion: Typically tools are in-built to convert arbitrary gene IDs to Enterz ID

Data Availability: The data can be experimental data or data from NCBI GEO, Cancer Genome Atlas, etc.

The implementation of analysis methods constrains the software to accept a specific input pathway data format, while the underlying graph models in the methods are independent of the input format. Regardless of the pathway format, this information must be parsed into a computer readable graph data structure before being processed. The implementation may incorporate a parser,or this may be up to the user. For instance, SPIA accepts any signaling pathway or network if it can be transformed into an adjacency matrix representing a directed graph where all nodes are components and all edges are interactions. NetGSA is similarly flexible with regard to signaling and metabolic pathways. SPIA provides KEGG signaling pathways as a set of pre-parsed adjacency matrices. The methods described in this chapter may be restricted to only one pathway database, or may accept several. Analysis methods and input types are listed in the table below from [this](https://bioinformatics.cse.unr.edu/publications/4966.pdf) article.

Output Formats

Pathway ontologies are the definitions of "pathway" used by each pathway database.Unifying ontologies across these databases is accomplished through the use of pathway standard languages. These are standard formats that seek to facilitate the exchange of pathway data between the databases and pathway analysis tools. A number of pathway data are based on the Extensible Markup Language (.xml) or in plain text (.txt) formats. Encoding pathways in such formats makes them readable for both humans and machines. Examples of these standard languages are: the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML;) the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN), or the Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX)[3]. Gene Matrix Transposed (GMT) format, which is used in gene set enrichment analyses and Simple Interaction Format (SIF) and extended SIF with additional fields, which are useful for network analysis and visualization are also commonly provided for pathway information download[6].

CASE STUDY 1

Loss of ASH1L in developing brains causes autistic-like behaviors in a mouse model 

BACKGROUND

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease associated with various gene mutations. Recent genetic and clinical studies report that mutations of the epigenetic gene ASH1L are highly associated with human ASD and intellectual disability (ID). However, the causal link between ASH1L mutations and ASD/ID remains undetermined. 

HYPOTHESIS/PROBLEM STATEMENT 

ASH1L is an epigenetic factor that regulates gene expression during development. To identify the genes regulated by ASH1L in developing brains, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses to examine differential gene expression between wild-type and Ash1L-deleted neural cells.

WORKFLOW

The NPCs (neural progenitor cell)were isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of brains and maintained in serum-free NPC culture medium. The deletion of Ash1L gene in the established NPCs was induced by 4-hydrotamoxifen (4OH-TAM) added in the medium for 10 days(mouse model).

To identify the differentially expressed genes in early NPC differentiation, we performed RNA-seq analyses 0, 12 and 24 hours after induced differentiation.

Results

DGE:The results identified total 2,475 upregulated and 2,808 downregulated genes during induced differentiation (cutoff: fold changes > 1.5, p < 0.01)

Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses showed the upregulated genes had enriched GO terms involving nervous system development, while the downregulated genes involved metabolic processes and cell cycle regulation (cutoff: FDR < 0.05) (Figure S3J-K, Table S1, S2). Among all 2,475 genes upregulated in the wild-type NPC differentiation, 70 genes were found to have significantly reduced expression in the Ash1L-KO cells (cutoff: fold changes > 1.5, p < 0.01) These genes downregulated in the Ash1L-KO cells had enriched GO terms involving telencephalon development, regulation of cell communication, brain development, and central nervous development (cutoff: FDR < 0.05) 

Reactome pathway enrichment analysis: Revealed involvement in postsynaptic signal transmission, including NMDA receptor activation (cutoff: FDR < 0.05). Notably, multiple genes, such as Emx2, Dbx2, Pcdh10, and Foxg1, that were previously reported to play critical roles in normal brain development and related neurodevelopmental diseases were found to have significantly reduced expression in the differentiating Ash1L-KO cells (cutoff: fold changes > 1.5, p < 0.01) (Figure 4D), suggesting that loss of ASH1L's function in activating genes critical for normal brain development might be a possible molecular mechanism linking ASH1L mutations to neurodevelopmental defects of ASD/ID.

INFERENCE

In this study, we used an animal model to demonstrate that the loss of Ash1L gene alone in developing mouse brains is sufficient to cause autistic-like behaviors and ID-like deficits in adult mice, which strongly suggests ASH1L gene mutations found in patients are likely to be the causative drivers leading to clinical ASD/ID.

CASE STUDY 2

PyGNA: a unified framework for geneset network analysis

Aim

Analysis of RNA sequencing data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project for 6 different types of cancer: 4 epithelial tumors, including 2 from urogenital tissues (BLCA and PRAD), 1 from breast (BRCA) and 1 from lung (LUSC), and 2 from liquid cancers (LAML and DLBC)

To  find whether differentially expressed genes in each cancer show a network effect, and whether they are similar to any other cancer analysed. It is possible to address these questions using the GNT and GNA tests implemented in PyGNA.

Workflow/methodology

TCGA data was retrieved  and differential expression analysis (DEA) was performed using the TCGABiolinks package. 

Data Platforms:  Gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue EXpression (GTEX) project as control-no control for  LUSC, LAML, and DLBC, and the TCGA tumor data processed by the Recount2 project to avoid biases introduced by different RNA quantification pipelines..Taken together, we retrieved 6 datasets providing mRNA abundance for ≈15000 genes for each tumor and performed differential expression analysis. For each dataset, all genes with FDR<0.01 and logFC|>3 were considered significant.
ANALYSES 

GNT and GNA are based on three models:

-   Direct interaction model

-   Shortest path interaction model

-   Random Walk with Restart (RWR) model

These three interaction models capture different topological properties. Direct models provide information about the neighborhood of a gene and its observed links. However, they might not be sufficiently powered to detect mid- and long-range interactions, thus statistics defined under these models are usually sensitive to missing links. Conversely, modelling gene interactions using shortest path provides a simple analytical framework to include local and global awareness of the connectivity. However, this approach is also sensitive to missing links and small-world effects, which is common in biological networks and could lead to false positives. The RWR model is more robust than the shortest path model, because it effectively adjusts interaction effects for network structure; it rewards nodes connected with many shortest paths, and penalizes those that are connected only by path going through high degree nodes.

The the strength of interaction between genes in the geneset (geneset network topology, GNT) and with genes in another geneset (geneset network association, GNA) are evaluated based on statistics using these model. 

GNT Statistics:

Let S=s1,...,sn be a geneset of n genes, each mapped to a node in G=(V,E). The aim is to find out whether the strength of interaction between nodes of the geneset is higher than expected by chance for a geneset of the same size.

-   Total degree statistic: The importance of a geneset S can be quantified as the number of edges connecting each node in S to any other node in the network

    ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/TFBxV9JakouiKx5a1UpJZcm30tI2cJot38B2D9jIsryM76_82NAG16gkJ9yus5BbxBAi_VydD-Eogi0HfhofssBRaLnHhkD57hdpny5CqauiMDCJ381CtquDXBwMFILPF66XiDjl)

-   Internal degree: With the direct interaction model, the strength of interaction for a geneset S can be quantified as the number of edges connecting each node in S to any other node in the geneset; we refer to this quantity as the internal degree of the node
    ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sWv5p9S3ZWHEqAN23L-VEj6UQSqHK7n-9TrZuktzsuorEgVMoyZ1F1axdYG3D5CxppMKx60vVnmFUWrs62iOdGpTGLY0g_Qe8LGnGzwTP-ntX640Kq_6UTkIPTwKPB4oLCeRScWr)
-   Shortest Path: The main concern regarding direct interaction methods is that they could fail in presence of missing links, which can be circumvented by shortest path method which takes into account the distance between nodes. Shortest path is the average of the minimum distance between each gene and the rest of those in S:

  ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0aAzF-yJwTV_GyQaCUti3iXS9tC9PSpB5zIukWBo-suYxs6AcOqVjpeggTJAr4y2pNtQRR3H41l9zfKQGUNzEMurSf5hMyNjQy7Ndi8kCQDKyFkepq2WJemiNO5vxfzxC7mUElIQ)

-   Under a RWR model, we can consider hij∈H as the heat transferred from node i to node j, which can be used as a measure of interaction strength between the nodes in the geneset S, as follows:

   ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/R29kXbSK4gGjzcTDGOrv5vZX9vPOlv5LNjqBDh7cAyNZt4JJm2vpi6PgCiCP89SyjSg3EDjQWnfVm36MOoM2AqKzbNfRMK0zV6JxI9hknWgqDrUxkNLs0LwNmDOlDXP3KchLOPrh)

Geneset network association statistics

Let S1 and S2 be two geneset with n and m genes respectively, we want to estimate the association between S1 and S2 as a function of the strength of interaction between their nodes.

Under a shortest path model, the association statistics USP is defined as follows:

Whereas, under a RWR model, we measure association as a function of the heat, UH, transferred between the two genesets as follows:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/pNFrWarxqb1BktJC4aWQCBtDERjy0DshwL03xuSeeanyFcNeGjuixsXbQtnyoZZsTqtqVOvz4zqf_CQaKYuzwlRczG9XFADGZ1bXnUXgN7xcxBC5Zga6wC9FccWHZuoPGsrMFTKQ)

Where the heat withheld by a gene is considered when there are overlapping genes between S1 and S2.

Hypothesis Testing

The topological and association statistics are ultimately used for hypothesis testing. A calibrated null distribution is needed to estimate whether the observed statistics are more extreme than what expected by chance using which, a bootstrap procedure is used to estimate null distributions of the test statistics, conditioned on the geneset size.

Thus, w.l.o.g, let Q be the null distribution of the test statistic q estimated for a geneset of size n, and ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XJeK67eNboaq0tH-m5YCWtbET8SYrlDwEE559PatIXDWxggXY3WwwJPgagrYaRvQECK60wSYx5sPIO_PTjRAtNy9dvx51BEQ1Kaa-B8ObW4yU3agKvjWESljd9pArBnCAGtuEEdv) the observed value. It is possible to derive an empirical p-value as follows:

 ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dU4jhvcZn0hQBFLBkB50iFBS_OVim_dfuZz8pqUPAMrejNFxl7lqcK3ques3HUgqlcPVcUb8soPwDMlQwZwXuxjNKdzf1axvkfcCwEVbrBTqdqBYjRDt5fF-n7fqTBM0ULZ7Enj8)

where I is the indicator function returning 1 if and only if the evaluated condition is true, and unit pseudo-count is added for continuity correction.

Benchmarking geneset network tests                  

Stochastic block models (SBM) was used for both GNA and GNT. 

SBM framework is used to simulate a network with k blocks, with a baseline probability of interaction within and between blocks, p0.

GNT:  k+<k blocks from the SBM matrix are selected  and set their within probability of connection M+ii = αp0, where α>1 is a scaling factor controlling the strength of interaction of the genes within block i compared to the rest of the genes in any other block.

GNA: k+  blocks are selected at random and set their within block connection probability to M+ii=αp0 and their between blocks connection to M+ij=γp0 for i≠j and α,γ>1. γ  was reparameterized as a function α, in order to control the relationship between the within and between block connection probability. 

Let β=γ/(α-1), the between block connection probability can be set as M+ij=p0+βp0(α-1). With this parametrization, 3 different scenarios can be simulated:

1)if β=0⇒M+ij=p0, the connection probability between blocks is equal to the baseline, thus genes in a block are highly connected.

2)if 0<β<1⇒p0<M+ij<M+ii, then the connection probability between the blocks is higher than the baseline, and thus we obtain assortative genesets.

3)if β>1⇒M+ij>M+ii, then we have non assortative genesets, thus we expect them to be detected by a GNA test.

After building a network, genesets can be generated by selecting two distinct blocks, i, j, with m nodes each, and add π×m nodes from block i and (1-π)×m nodes from block j; for simplicity, we picked genes from blocks containing the same number of genes. 

By varying the size of highly connected blocks and their interaction probability, along with the geneset composition, it is possible to assess the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) of both GNT and GNA tests.    

USE CASE

PyGNA was used to perform GNT analysis and GNA analysis between all cancer datasets, using the BioGRID interaction network.

For each test, PyGNA returns the results as a CSV file, which includes descriptive statistics and the parameters of the null distribution used for hypothesis testing.  PyGNA plotting tool (paint-summary-gnt) twas used o visualize a summary of the GNT results for all datasets,  where the test statistic was reported as a z-score, to make them comparable across different tests.GNA analysis between all differentially expressed genesets was performed using the command (paint-comparison-matrix) in PyGNA.

RESULTS

GNT: Only differentially expressed genes in lung and lymphoid cancers show a significant network effect, albeit this is detected by all tests for lung cancer and only by TH and TID lymphoid neoplasm. 

Network effect wasn't observed for the other cancers; this could be explained by the fact these cancers might be controlled not by one highly connected network, but by multiple distinct ones.

GNA: While most of them do not seem to show a consistent network effect, GNA can be used to test whether each set of differentially expressed genes are more connected with each other than expected by chance.Using either UH and USP tests, a significant association between breast, bladder, and prostate carcinomas, and between leukemia and lymphoid neoplasms was observed which is consistent with other gene expression analyses, that have shown that anatomically related cancers or with similar histopathology share similar changes in gene expression.

Significant association between lung and lymphoid neoplasms observed in the study might be explained by the fact that lungs contain a vast lymphatic network, which might also be dysregulated in lung tumors.

Conclusion: PyGNA enables network analysis of RNA sequencing datasets and provide useful biological insights about the association between the genes.

CASE STUDY 3

In silico Pathway Activation Network Decomposition Analysis (iPANDA) as a method for biomarker development

BACKGROUND

The inherent complexity of gene network interactions and high diversity of experimental platforms and inconsistency of the data coming from the various types of equipment pose a major challenge in analysing transcriptomics data posing a need for the development of the new large-scale analytical methodologies that infer complex transcriptomic changes more accurately into the network of biologically relevant signalling axes.

Breast cancer data was chosen for the analysis as one of the most challenging in several ways. Since breast cancer has a high degree of intertumour and intratumoural heterogeneity, this cancer type is one of the most difficult in terms of outcome and treatment response prediction. This is especially true for a group of tumours with poor prognosis and fewer number of effective treatments. Thus, traditional methods for transcriptomic data analysis may not be sufficient in this particular case.

The aim is to show that iPANDA is capable of producing highly robust sets of pathway markers, which can be further used for stratification of samples into responder and non-responder groups using neoadjuvant therapy pretreatment breast cancer data with known treatment outcome and receptor status (estrogen receptor and HER2). 

Data Availability and Platform

Six data sets containing gene expression data related to breast cancer patients treated with paclitaxel and three data sets containing transcriptomic data from normal cancer-free breast tissue which were used as a reference from GEO.The MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) data set (GEO identifier 5350) was obtained from the GEO database.

Platforms: Affymetrix, Agilent

Algorithm

-   The topological weight of each gene is proportional to the number of independent paths through the pathway gene network represented as a directed graph.

-   The computation of topological coefficients for a set of coexpressed genes is inefficient, unless a group of coexpressed genes is being considered as a single unit. To circumvent this challenge, gene modules reflecting the coexpression of genes are introduced in the iPANDA algorithm. 

-   The contribution of gene units (including gene modules and individual genes) to pathway activation is computed as a product of their fold changes in logarithmic scale, topological and statistical weights. Then the contributions are multiplied by a discrete coefficient which equals to +1 or -1 in the case of pathway activation or suppression by the particular unit, respectively. Finally, the activation scores, which we refer to as iPANDA values, are obtained as a linear combination of the scores calculated for gene units that contribute to the pathway activation/suppression. 

### Biomarker identification and relevance: Methodology and Results

-   Measure receiver operating characteristics area under curve (AUC) values to assess the capability of transcriptomic pathway markers to distinguish between two groups of samples: 

-   Gene expression data sets from breast cancer patients with measured response to paclitaxel treatment

-   Pathway activation scores for each sample obtained

-   Lists of the top 30 paclitaxel treatment sensitivity pathway markers obtained for the estrogen receptor negative (ERN) HER2-positive (HER2P) and ERN HER2-negative (HER2N) breast cancer types were obtained.

-   Four and five independent data sets were used for comparison of ERN HER2P and ERN HER2N cancer types

-   Ranked based on AUC values

-   The lists of markers differ significantly between cancer types--complies with the observation that the mechanisms of paclitaxel treatment resistance depend on the breast cancer subtype

-   Produces consistent results for different data sets obtained independently for the same biological case--iPANDA values for 19 and 8 pathways for ERN HER2P and ERN HER2N breast cancer types, respectively, can be utilized as paclitaxel response classifiers with AUC values higher than 0.7 for all data sets examined

-   The common marker pathway (CMP) index to estimate the robustness of the biomarker lists: the combined implementation of the gene modules along with the topology-based coefficients serves as an effective way of noise reduction in gene expression data and allows one to obtain stable pathway activation scores for a set of independent data

-   Pathway activation scores obtained using iPANDA were applied to the identification of paclitaxel neoadjuvant therapy sensitivity in breast cancer: the models developed using normalized iPANDA scores distinguished paclitaxel treatment responders from non-responders with high accuracy

Conclusions

Application of the pathway activation measurement implemented in iPANDA leads to significant noise reduction in the input data to produce highly consistent sets of biologically relevant biomarkers acquired on multiple transcriptomic data sets. More robust since it takes both gene expression and pathway activation into account since they both have their unique insights to offer from the context of a disease.

   _Epigenetic deregulation:_  
   Most human protein-coding genes harbor multiple transcription starting sites. Promoter regions near these sites regulate transcription and transcript isoforms (multiple combinations of exons within introns translate to different proteins). Tumor-causing methylation in promoter regions can use this mechanism to activate oncogenes/ reduce tumor suppressor genes. Similar to CNA, methylation alteration at gene promoters typically does not alter the coding sequences of 
genes, but contributes to cancer by influencing gene expression. 

   DNAme is also thought to be an important disease-defining feature in many cancers, pointing to the cancer's cell of origin and predictive of the outcome. DNAme changes in cancer have been described along two principal axes: global hypomethylation affecting retroviral elements and genome stability, and focal hypermethylation at promoters of tumor suppressor genes.

   Promoter hypermethylation of TSGs has been surveyed across cancer in TCGA and other studies : DNA repair (MLH1, RBBP8), cell cycle (CDKN2A, CDKN2B), p53 network (CDKN2A, TP73), apoptosis (WIF1, SFRP1), Ras signaling (RASSF1), Wnt signaling (SOX17), and tyrosine kinase cascades (SOCS3).

   Measuring genome-wide DNAm in large numbers of specimens typically uses microarray-based technologies such as the Illumina HumanMethylation450 (450 K) and HumanMethylationEPIC (850 K) [14] arrays, which yield an approximation to the proportion of DNA copies that are methylated at each specific cytosine locus, and are reported as beta values.

   **AIM**: Identify methylation driver genes from passenger genes
MethSig accounts for varying stochastic and disordered hypermethylation rates across genome which results in heterogeneity in the tumor. This is a big challenge in distinguishing driver from passenger genes.
Widely used statistical methods produce thousands of candidate promoter hypermethylation sites, most of which are passengers, very few drivers.

   **DHcR**:  
- Promoter hypermethylation can be measured using differentially hypermethylated cytosine ratio (DHcR) = hypermethylated cytosines (HC) / total number of CpGs profiled in promoters.   
- Uniform background models use the average DHcR which implies assuming a constant HC rate, when in reality the HC rate varies across the genome. This leads to many passenger genes being identified as drivers.   
- Our model uses variable DHcR. This means, MethSig compares a calculated expected methylation rate with promoter specific methylation rate (tumor vs expected).
- This expected value is calculated using a beta regression model and below covariates.  
- How do we know if the BETA model is a good estimate of tumor DHcR value? The drivers were cross-patient aggregated from a large population, not a particular subgroup, as a driver would affect large number of patients.   

   **Covariates included**:  
   (i) Silenced gene expression   
   (ii) Replication time  
   (iii) Proportion of discordant reads (PDR)- If all the CpGs on a specific read are methylated or unmethylated, the read is classified as concordant. Otherwise, it is classified as discordant. At each CpG, the PDR is equal to the number of discordant reads divided by the total number of reads that cover that location. Promoter PDR is given by averaging the values of individual CpGs, as calculated for all CpGs within the promoter of interest that are covered by a minimum of 10 reads that contain at least 4 CpGs. The normal PDR was calculated by averaging PDR of all the normal samples.
Samples with High PDR- low reliability as drivers and vice-versa.

   **Benchmarking against other models:**  
   (i) Q-Q plots with p-values

   (ii) Robustness across datasets- MethSig was applied to individual datasets of 3 tumor types in CLL RRBS. MethSig resulted in a well-calibrated Q-Q plot and a deviation factor closer to 1, compared with benchmarked methods.
   (iii) Accuracy of identified drivers-  MethSig drivers had large overlap with top selections from other studies with similar p value cutoffs. MethSig achieved higher performance compared with benchmarked methods in identifying DNAme drivers associated with gene silencing.
   (iv) MethSig-array designed for methylation arrays generated from Illumina also performed better against other methods with q-q plots and deviation closer to 1.

   **Biological validation:**   
    (i) Diagnosis: Using pathway enrichment analysis (link), established TSGs in many identified drivers, many genes part of core cell pathways associated with cancer, and the whole section under “Candidate CLL DNAme Drivers Include Established TSGs and Were Functionally Validated to Enhance Cancer Cell Fitness”

    (ii) Prognosis: Refer section under “MethSig-nominated CLL DNAme Drivers Provide Independent Prognostic Information and Are Associated with Adverse Outcomes”.

    (iii) Evaluating the clustering of methylated CpG positions- Promoters with a nonrandom distribution of methylated CpGs are more likely to exert repression on corresponding genes and result in a substantial phenotypic impact. MethSig observed higher clustering of methylated positions in hypermethylated drivers.
